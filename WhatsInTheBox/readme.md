# WhatsInTheBox

A three-tier docker compose application 'stack'. Database backend, servercore middle tier, nano server front-end.

## WhatsItDo?

At present, mostly used to figure out what's in - and what's not in - the images. Most changes will be me trying to configure stuff and most likely failing. Like `NFS-Client`, which is not there.
