# DockerLab

Docker experiments and stuff.

## More info

This is just a repo for various experiments and tools around the docker world.

### What's interesting?

Not much really. There's a [useful container](Pwsh-DummyContainer) if you're doing automation stuff in the Cloud and just want a dummy container that doesn't do much (it just calls the BrewDog Punk API, finds a random beer and logs it). That can be used from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/stopthatastronaut/pwshdummycontainer). I built it to test out a scheduled task platform built on Azure Container Instances, which is kinda fun.

### Related

There's another repo called [CI-Images](/stopthatastronaut/CI-Images), which is docker-based images for CircleCI work. Not much in there right now but it'll grow over time.
